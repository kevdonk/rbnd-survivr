How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?

I used define_method to iterate through a list of colors and create methods based
on that list, as opposed to defining each individually.

How long did you spend working on this project?

I'm not sure, since it was spread out over such a long time.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

Figuring out the actual requirements of the project between the submission instructions
and the rubric was the most challenging and rewarding part of the experience.

Where do you still have room to grow?

Based on my misunderstanding initially, I have room to grow in the reading of instructions.
